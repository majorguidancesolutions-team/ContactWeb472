# Contact Web 4.7.2

This is the original Contact Web application from the MVC quickstart course.  This was used over the past 5 years up to the release of .Net 5, and the new version of the course material leverages .Net 6.  

This is considered a completed work but should only be used for training purposes only.

Any use of this code is at your own risk and we make no guarantees or promises for anything you decide to do with this code.

This code should **not** be considered production ready.

## Original Repository

The original repository for this project has been made private and retired.

The code was built from the ground up as part of our ASP.Net MVC quickstart course available on [our website](https://training.majorguidancesolutions.com/courses/asp-net-mvc-quickstart) and at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/aspnet-mvc-quick-start/).

## Why this copy

Again, this was the legacy version leading up to the course restructuring in late 2021.  The only reason this copy exists as a stand-alone copy is so that we can use it in other training, including an [upcoming and ongoing AZ-900 event](https://training.majorguidancesolutions.com/courses/azure-fundamentals-understand-and-master-the-fundamentals), and offer the code if others want to mess around with it for training purposes.

## Final notes

Once again, I urge you to never use this code in production as it is out of date with the latest .Net technologies. While the concepts in this repo were sound and effective in the past, you should avoid using this code for anything other than training and learning purposes.

Again, simply put, this code should **NOT** be used for any sort of production work.
